# Dynamic Sparse Network in Sleep Apnea Time Series Classification

Recent advances show that machine learning models can automatically detect obstructive sleep apnea episodes based on single-lead ECG data. This method is much more efficient and accessible as opposed to the traditionally used PSG tests which are time-consuming and expensive. While high classification accuracy has been achieved, there might be an opportunity in reducing the computational complexity of the architectures. In this paper, we propose using an existing Dynamic Sparse Network for time series classification to solve the same detection problem by reducing the computational complexity and maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy. Different kernel sizes and different levels of sparsities were tested. Furthermore, the DSN model was compared to its own dense version and two other dense networks. The performance of the models was tested by measuring the accuracy. The computational complexity was measuring the FLOPS and number of parameters. The optimal parameters were chosen to be a kernel size of 30, and a sparsity of 95%. With these parameters, the DSN model had an average accuracy of 91.82% Â±0.84% which was higher than the two dense networks and had significantly lower computational costs. The DSN can be deemed adequate for detecting sleep apnea events, especially in the case of low computational resources.
